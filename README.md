# Customisable-Gesture-Recognition-System-using-Siamese-Neural-Networks-and-Haar-Cascade-Algorithm

There has been a lot of work in the field of gesture
recognition in the last few decades but all of them compel
the user to use a set of gestures that are predefined by the
maker. This turns out to be a huge pitfall for motor impaired
people as they are constricted in terms of movement and
may not be able to accomplish gestures predefined by the
system.

We have built a customizable dynamic hand
gesture recognition which will be useful for them. When the
user operates the system for the first time, he has to record 3
gestures for controlling 3 different applications.

We are making the code open source so that further contributions can be made to it.
